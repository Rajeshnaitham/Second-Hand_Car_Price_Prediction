# Car Price Prediction System 🚗

A machine learning–based regression project that predicts car prices using vehicle attributes and historical market data.

## Objective
To build a reliable regression model that estimates car prices based on features such as brand, model, year, mileage, and fuel type.

## Approach
- Data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering
- Trained regression models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Built preprocessing and inference pipeline
- Deployed model as an interactive application for real-time predictions

## Tech Stack
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Machine Learning

## Outcome
Provides accurate and real-time car price predictions to support informed buying and selling decisions.
