Project Overview

Accurately estimating car prices is essential for buyers and sellers to make informed decisions in a competitive automotive market.
This project focuses on building a machine learning–based regression system that predicts car prices using vehicle attributes and historical market data.

Objective

To develop a robust and reliable regression model that can predict the market price of a car based on key features such as brand, model, year, mileage, and fuel type.

Dataset & Inputs
Historical car listing data including:

Brand & model
Manufacturing year
Mileage
Fuel type
Other vehicle attributes
Structured tabular dataset used for supervised learning
User inputs provided through an interactive application interface.

Technical Approach

Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering
Trained and tuned multiple regression models:
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Compared models using appropriate evaluation metrics
Built a consistent preprocessing and inference pipeline
Deployed the trained model as an interactive application for real-time car price prediction

Technologies & Tools

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Machine Learning (Regression)
Model Deployment Framework (e.g., Streamlit / Flask)

Key Skills Demonstrated

Regression modeling & supervised learning
Feature engineering and model evaluation
End-to-end machine learning pipelines
Model deployment and user-facing ML applications
Translating predictive models into real-world decision tools

Outcome
The final system provides accurate and real-time car price predictions, helping users avoid underpricing or overpricing vehicles in the market.

Future Enhancements

Add deep learning models for improved accuracy
Expand dataset with real-time market listings
Integrate API-based predictions for wider usage
